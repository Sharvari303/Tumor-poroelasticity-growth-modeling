1. Chempotgrad.py fits a logistic function to chemical potential gradient/velocity data generated from the FEM simulations.

2. advection-diffusion-PDE-solver.jl solves the PDE numerically and generates spatiotemporal growth factor concentration profiles under different Peclet number and Scenario runs.

3. Sample PhysiCell directory used for tumro growth ABM simulations.
